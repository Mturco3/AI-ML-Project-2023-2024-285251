- ## INTRODUCTION

As part of your duties as senior data scientist for the famous ThomasTrain company, we were assigned to understand the satisfaction of the customers even without a direct evaluation. To accomplish this task,we were provided  with the “trains_dataset.csv”.

First of all we used the Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) to study carefully the the csv file and each categorical and numerical variable we had. We preprocessed the data handling missing values (substituting these with the mode), encoding the categories and removing the outilers. 

The final goal was to choose and improve a machine learning model able to classify the customers as "satisfied" or "unsatisfied" with high accuracy, taking into consideration the understanding behind the satisfaction of the clients.
